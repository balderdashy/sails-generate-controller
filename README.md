> This is a built-in generator exposed by the `sails` command-line interface, installed automatically when you run `npm install -g sails`.  But you can override it globally, or on a per-app basis, by installing a custom generator.  See [**Extending Sails > Generators**](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/generators) for more information.
